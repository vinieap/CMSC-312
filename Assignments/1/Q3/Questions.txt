a) Discuss and evaluate what happens when you're running both in separate
windows and you kill one or the other.
    - When you kill spock first, kirk keeps running and buffers the messages so they will be recieved and printed by spock when run again.
    If you kill kirk first then it will also kill spock because of an invalid argument error.
    You also cannot run spock first because there is no messenger to get messages from so it throws an error

b) Discuss what happens (and why) when you run two copies of kirk.
    - Everything works fine because the messages are queued so which ever ordered they are recieved is the order the messages will be printed.
    The messages are printed in the order they are sent to the spock program.

c) Discuss what happens (and why) when your run two copies of spock.
    - The messages are recieved sequentially based on the order of the spock programs ran and they will each recieve 1 message in a cyclic order.
    This is because the recievers are connecting to the sender via a queue so once they recieve a message they go back to the end of the queue and wait till they get to the front again.
